Due to the findings above, I did check some workarounds that we could do. The first one is there is a parameter for trino to make query wait for minimum number of workers before it starts. But currently we can't use that because we're scaling the number of workers based on CPU usage. And if we are blocking any task, If we are blocking any task to execute in the worker, then the CPU usage won't really increase and autoscaling won't kick in
I did check if we increase the sensitivity of scaling if that would help but it doesn't help so the number of initial workers during the query execution is important compared so even if the cluster like creates workers like in just 30 seconds upon the first query. That wouldn't work because the query planning stage of trino already has been finished during that time.

Based on the findings, I checked for potential solutions. The first option is a parameter for Trino to delay queries until there are enough workers available. However, we cannot use this currently as we scale worker numbers based on CPU usage. If tasks are blocked from executing in a worker, CPU usage will not increase, and auto-scaling won't initiate.

I also investigated increasing the sensitivity of scaling but found it to be ineffective. Even if the cluster rapidly creates workers within 30 seconds after the first query, this wouldn't work because Trino's query planning stage would have already completed by then.
